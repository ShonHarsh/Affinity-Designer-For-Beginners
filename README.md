# Affinity Designer For Beginners

This project is my course work for the [Affinity Designer For Beginners - Updated For Version 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/affinity-designer-for-beginners-version-2/) class on Udemy.  The course is taught by Ally Anderson under the name [Affinity Revolution](https://affinityrevolution.com/).  I am getting the full soon but I used the 7 day trial to complete this.  I recommend trying it out.

I was amazed at the content I was able to produce in this course.  I am not artistic but Ally took me through every step to produce images I am proud of.  I really love the EXPLORE badge!

### Details
This project was completed on Affinity Designer 2.4.2 on 2024-06-06.  You can clone my repository but the course files might have any changes since I completed the course.
